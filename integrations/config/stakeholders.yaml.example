# Stakeholder Graph — Example Template
#
# This file is the COMMITTED template. Copy it to stakeholders.yaml and fill
# in your real delegates. The actual stakeholders.yaml is gitignored and
# never committed — it stays local to your machine.
#
# Usage:
#   cp stakeholders.yaml.example stakeholders.yaml
#   Edit stakeholders.yaml with your real team.
#
# Fields:
#   name          — Full name. Stored locally only. Never used in TASKS.md.
#   alias         — Array of lookup terms. FIRST ITEM = display name (used in TASKS.md
#                   and all output). Additional items are alternate names, last names,
#                   nicknames, or shorthand you use in real conversation.
#                   Example: ["Jordan V.", "Vargas", "JV"]
#                   Backward compat: a plain string alias still works.
#   role          — Job title or working description
#   relationship  — direct_report | peer | vendor | partner
#   domains       — List of work areas this person can own. Used for matching.
#   capacity_signal — high | medium | low — your subjective read, update manually
#   contact_hint  — Optional: preferred channel (Slack, email, etc.)
#   notes         — Optional: communication preferences, caveats, context
#
# Matching logic:
#   Domain keywords are matched against task title and description.
#   Scores: domain match (+3 each), direct_report (+2), peer (+1),
#           capacity high (+2), medium (+1), low (-1).
#   Highest scorer is suggested. Ties broken by relationship type.
#
# Alias resolution:
#   When /intake sees "Requested by: Vargas", it resolves to "Jordan V." before
#   writing to TASKS.md. All alias entries are checked case-insensitively.
