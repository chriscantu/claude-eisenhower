# Calendar Configuration

Controls which Mac Calendar is queried for availability checks during
`/schedule` and `/scan-email`. Read-only — this plugin never creates,
modifies, or deletes calendar events.

---

## Settings

calendar_name: YOUR_CALENDAR_NAME

---

## How It's Used

The `calendar_name` value is passed to `scripts/cal_query.swift` whenever
availability is checked:

```applescript
do shell script "swift ~/repos/claude-eisenhower/scripts/cal_query.swift '" & calendar_name & "' {DAYS} {FORMAT} 2>&1"
```

Used in:
- `/schedule` — optional availability check before locking in a Q2 focus block date
- `/scan-email` Step 6 — escalation logic for Admin/Compliance emails with due dates

## Performance Note

If your calendar has a large number of events (thousands), the Swift EventKit
script handles this efficiently. **Do NOT use AppleScript's `whose` clause** for
calendar queries — it is O(n) on total event count and will time out on large
calendars. The Swift script uses indexed CalendarStore queries and is instant
regardless of calendar size.

## How to Set Up

1. Copy this file: `cp calendar-config.md.example calendar-config.md`
2. Set `calendar_name` to the exact name of your calendar as it appears
   in the Mac Calendar app sidebar (case-sensitive).
3. The actual `calendar-config.md` is gitignored — never committed.
