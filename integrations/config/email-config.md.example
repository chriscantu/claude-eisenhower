# Email Configuration

Controls which Apple Mail account and inbox `/scan-email` reads from.
Strictly read-only — this plugin never marks emails as read, moves them,
or modifies them in any way.

## Settings

account_name: YOUR_MAIL_ACCOUNT_NAME
inbox_name:   INBOX

---

## How It's Used

The `account_name` value is used to locate the mail account in Apple Mail:

```applescript
tell application "Mail"
  set targetAccount to first account whose name contains "{account_name}"
  set targetMailbox to mailbox "{inbox_name}" of targetAccount
end tell
```

Used in:
- `/scan-email` — all steps that read email subjects, senders, dates, and body previews

## Settings Reference

**account_name** — The name of the mail account in Apple Mail, or a unique
substring of it. The scan uses `contains` matching, so "Acme" will match
an account named "Acme (you@acme.com)".

**inbox_name** — The exact mailbox name inside that account. Common values:
- `INBOX` (most accounts)
- `Inbox` (some accounts use title case)

To confirm the exact inbox name: run `/scan-email` and Claude will
auto-detect it in Step 2, or check Apple Mail → [Account] → inbox label.

## Scope Restriction

Only the configured account and inbox are ever read. No other mailboxes,
accounts, sent mail, or folders are accessed.

## How to Set Up

1. Copy this file: `cp email-config.md.example email-config.md`
2. Set `account_name` to a unique substring of your mail account name
   as it appears in Apple Mail.
3. Set `inbox_name` to the exact inbox label (usually `INBOX`).
4. The actual `email-config.md` is gitignored — never committed.
