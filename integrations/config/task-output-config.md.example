## How to Set Up

1. Copy this file: `cp task-output-config.md.example task-output-config.md`
2. Set `list_name` under `### reminders` to the name of your Reminders list.
   It will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.
3. The actual `task-output-config.md` is gitignored — never committed.

## How to Switch Adapters

1. Install the MCP connector for the new system via Cowork plugin settings
2. Create `integrations/adapters/[system].md` following the interface in `adapters/README.md`
3. Change `Active Adapter` above to the new adapter name (e.g., `asana`)
4. Fill in the adapter-specific settings under the matching `### [system]` block
5. No changes needed to `commands/schedule.md` or any skill files

See `integrations/adapters/README.md` for the full adapter contract.
