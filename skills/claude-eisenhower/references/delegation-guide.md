# Delegation Framework

For Directors of Engineering, delegation is not offloading — it's a strategic decision about who is best positioned to act and grow.

## The 3-Question Delegation Test

Ask these before assigning Q3 tasks to yourself:

1. **Does this require my authority or judgment specifically?**
   - YES → Keep it (but still consider Q3 if not important)
   - NO → Delegate candidate

2. **Is there someone who could do this and grow from it?**
   - YES → Strong delegation candidate (develop your team)
   - NO → Keep it or find an efficient path to done

3. **Would delegating this create more work for me than doing it?**
   - YES → Do it yourself or eliminate it
   - NO → Delegate with a clear brief

## Delegation Brief Format

When delegating, create a clear brief:
- **Task**: What needs to be done
- **Outcome**: What "done" looks like (specific, verifiable)
- **By when**: Hard deadline or "async/when possible"
- **Resources**: What they need access to
- **Check-in**: When you want a status update (not micromanagement — just alignment)
- **Authority level**: Can they make decisions, or do they need your sign-off?

## Tracking Delegated Tasks

Every delegated task creates a stakeholder follow-up record:
- Who it was delegated to
- What was agreed
- When you expect completion or a status update

Use the productivity:memory-management skill to track these. Review delegated items weekly during scheduling.

## Common Delegation Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Delegating without context | Always share the "why" |
| Checking in too often | Set a specific check-in date upfront |
| Taking tasks back when they're slow | Coach instead |
| Delegating only the easy stuff | Stretch assignments develop your team |
| Delegating without authority | Define decision rights clearly |

## When NOT to Delegate

- Personnel decisions (performance, compensation, firing)
- Sensitive communications on your behalf (represent yourself)
- Strategic commitments to executives or cross-functional leaders
- Crisis situations requiring your technical or organizational authority
